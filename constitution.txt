The Delegates who convened at the Federal Convention on May
25, 1787, quickly rejected the idea of revising the Articles of Confederation
and agreed to construct a new framework for a national
government. Throughout the summer months at the Convention in
Philadelphia, delegates from 12 States debated the proper form
such a government should take, but few questioned the need to establish
a more vigorous government to preside over the union of
States. The 39 delegates who signed the Constitution on September
17, 1787, expected the new charter to provide a permanent guarantee
of the political liberties achieved in the Revolution.
Prior to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, the Articles of
Confederation, drafted by the Continental Congress and approved
by 13 States, provided for a union of the former British colonies.
Even before Maryland became the last State to accede to the Articles
in 1781, a number of Americans, particularly those involved in
the prosecution of the Revolutionary War, recognized the inadequacies
of the Articles as a national government. In the 1780s these
nationally-minded Americans became increasingly disturbed by the
Articles’ failure to provide the central government with authority
to raise revenue, regulate commerce, or enforce treaties.
Despite repeated proposals that the Continental Congress revise
the Articles, the movement for a new national government began
outside the Congress. Representatives of Maryland and Virginia,
meeting at Mt. Vernon to discuss trade problems between the two
States, agreed to invite delegates from all States to discuss commercial
affairs at a meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, in September
1786. Although delegates from only five States reached the Annapolis
Convention, that group issued a call for a meeting of all States
to discuss necessary revisions of the Articles of Confederation. Responding
to this call and the endorsement of the Continental Congress,
every State except Rhode Island selected delegates for the
meeting in the State House at Philadelphia.
The document printed here was the product of nearly four
months of deliberations in the Federal Convention at Philadelphia.
The challenging task before the delegates was to create a republican
form of government that could encompass the 13 States and
accommodate the anticipated expansion to the West. The distribution
of authority between legislative, executive, and judicial
branches was a boldly original attempt to create an energetic central
government at the same time that the sovereignty of the people
was preserved.
The longest debate of the Convention centered on the proper
form of representation and election for the Congress. The division
between small States that wished to perpetuate the equal representation
of States in the Continental Congress and the large States
that proposed representation proportional to population threatened

vi HISTORICAL NOTE
to bring the Convention proceedings to a halt. Over several weeks
the delegates developed a complicated compromise that provided
for equal representation of the States in a Senate elected by State
legislature and proportional representation in a popularly-elected
House of Representatives.
The conflict between large and small States disappeared in the
early years of the republic. More lasting was the division between
slave and free States that had been a disturbing undercurrent in
the Convention debates. The Convention’s strained attempt to
avoid using the word slavery in the articles granting recognition
and protection to that institution scarcely hid the regional divisions
that would remain unresolved under the terms of union agreed to
in 1787.
The debates in the State ratification conventions of 1787 and
1788 made clear the need to provide amendments to the basic
framework drafted in Philadelphia. Beginning with Massachusetts,
a number of State conventions ratified the Constitution with the
request that a bill of rights be added to protect certain liberties at
the core of English and American political traditions. The First
Congress approved a set of amendments which became the Bill of
Rights when ratified by the States in 1791. The continuing process
of amendment, clearly described in the note of the following text,
has enabled the Constitution to accommodate changing conditions
in American society at the same time that the Founders’ basic outline
of national government remains intact.

1This text of the Constitution follows the engrossed copy signed by Gen. Washington and the
deputies from 12 States. The small superior figures preceding the paragraphs designate clauses,
and were not in the original and have no reference to footnotes.
The Constitution was adopted by a convention of the States on September 17, 1787, and was
subsequently ratified by the several States, on the following dates: Delaware, December 7, 1787;
Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788;
Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788;
South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788.
Ratification was completed on June 21, 1788.
The Constitution was subsequently ratified by Virginia, June 25, 1788; New York, July 26,
1788; North Carolina, November 21, 1789; Rhode Island, May 29, 1790; and Vermont, January
10, 1791.
In May 1785, a committee of Congress made a report recommending an alteration in the Articles
of Confederation, but no action was taken on it, and it was left to the State Legislatures
to proceed in the matter. In January 1786, the Legislature of Virginia passed a resolution providing
for the appointment of five commissioners, who, or any three of them, should meet such
commissioners as might be appointed in the other States of the Union, at a time and place to
be agreed upon, to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to consider how far
a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest
and their permanent harmony; and to report to the several States such an act, relative to this
great object, as, when ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress effectually
to provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners, after some correspondence, fixed the first
Monday in September as the time, and the city of Annapolis as the place for the meeting, but
only four other States were represented, viz: Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania;
the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and
Rhode Island failed to attend. Under the circumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners
present agreed upon a report (drawn by Mr. Hamilton, of New York) expressing their
unanimous conviction that it might essentially tend to advance the interests of the Union if the
States by which they were respectively delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to procure
the concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of commissioners to meet at Philadelphia
on the second Monday of May following, to take into consideration the situation of the
United States; to devise such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render
the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union; and to report
such an act for that purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when agreed
to by them and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State, would effectually provide
for the same.
Congress, on the 21st of February, 1787, adopted a resolution in favor of a convention, and
the Legislatures of those States which had not already done so (with the exception of Rhode
Island) promptly appointed delegates. On the 25th of May, seven States having convened,
George Washington, of Virginia, was unanimously elected President, and the consideration of
the proposed constitution was commenced. On the 17th of September, 1787, the Constitution as
engrossed and agreed upon was signed by all the members present, except Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts,
and Messrs. Mason and Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the convention transmitted
it to Congress, with a resolution stating how the proposed Federal Government should

be put in operation, and an explanatory letter. Congress, on the 28th of September, 1787, directed
the Constitution so framed, with the resolutions and letter concerning the same, to ‘‘be
transmitted to the several Legislatures in order to be submitted to a convention of delegates
chosen in each State by the people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention.’’ On the 4th of March, 1789, the day which had been fixed for commencing the operations of
Government under the new Constitution, it had been ratified by the conventions chosen in each
State to consider it, as follows: Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787;
New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts,
February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New
Hampshire, June 21, 1788; Virginia, June 25, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788.
The President informed Congress, on the 28th of January, 1790, that North Carolina had ratified
the Constitution November 21, 1789; and he informed Congress on the 1st of June, 1790,
that Rhode Island had ratified the Constitution May 29, 1790. Vermont, in convention, ratified
the Constitution January 10, 1791, and was, by an act of Congress approved February 18, 1791,
‘‘received and admitted into this Union as a new and entire member of the United States.’’ 2The part of this clause relating to the mode of apportionment of representatives among the

[EDITORIAL NOTE: There is some conflict as to the exact dates of
ratification of the amendments by the several States. In some
cases, the resolutions of ratification were signed by the officers of
the legislatures on dates subsequent to that on which the second
house had acted. In other cases, the Governors of several of the
States ‘‘approved’’ the resolutions (on a subsequent date), although
action by the Governor is not contemplated by article V, which required
ratification by the legislatures (or conventions) only. In a
number of cases, the journals of the State legislatures are not
available. The dates set out in this document are based upon the
best information available.]

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION NOT
RATIFIED BY THE STATES
During the course of our history, in addition to the 27 amendments
that have been ratified by the required three-fourths of the
States, six other amendments have been submitted to the States
but have not been ratified by them.
Beginning with the proposed Eighteenth Amendment, Congress
has customarily included a provision requiring ratification within
seven years from the time of the submission to the States. The Supreme
Court in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939), declared
that the question of the reasonableness of the time within which
a sufficient number of States must act is a political question to be
determined by the Congress.
In 1789, twelve proposed articles of amendment were submitted
to the States. Of these, Articles III–XII were ratified and became
the first ten amendments to the Constitution, popularly known as
the Bill of Rights. In 1992, proposed Article II was ratified and became
the 27th amendment to the Constitution. Proposed Article I
which was not ratified is as follows:
‘‘ARTICLE THE FIRST
‘‘After the first enumeration required by the first article of the Constitution, there
shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until the number shall
amount to one hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress,
that there shall be not less than one-hundred Representatives, nor less than
one Representative for every forty thousand persons, until the number of Representatives
shall amount to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated
by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred Representatives, nor
more than one Representative for every fifty thousand persons.’’
Thereafter, in the 2d session of the Eleventh Congress, the Congress
proposed the following article of amendment to the Constitution
relating to acceptance by citizens of the United States of titles
of nobility from any foreign government.
The proposed amendment, which was not ratified by threefourths
of the States, is as follows:
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, two thirds of both houses concurring, That the following
section be submitted to the legislatures of the several states, which, when ratified
by the legislatures of three fourths of the states, shall be valid and binding, as a
part of the constitution of the United States.
If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive or retain any title
of nobility or honour, or shall, without the consent of Congress, accept and retain
any present, pension, office or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor,
king, prince or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United
States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under them,
or either of them.
The following amendment to the Constitution relating to slavery
was proposed by the 2d session of the Thirty-sixth Congress on

March 2, 1861, when it passed the Senate, having previously
passed the House on February 28, 1861. It is interesting to note
in this connection that this is the only proposed (and not ratified)
amendment to the Constitution to have been signed by the President.
The President’s signature is considered unnecessary because
of the constitutional provision that on the concurrence of two-thirds
of both Houses of Congress the proposal shall be submitted to the
States for ratification.
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That the following article be proposed to the Legislatures
of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
which, when ratified by three-fourths of said Legislatures, shall be valid, to all intents
and purposes, as part of the said Constitution, viz:
‘‘ARTICLE THIRTEEN
‘‘No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give
to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic
institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws
of said State.’’
A child labor amendment was proposed by the 1st session of the
Sixty-eighth Congress on June 2, 1926, when it passed the Senate,
having previously passed the House on April 26, 1926. The proposed
amendment, which has been ratified by 28 States, to date,
is as follows:
JOINT RESOLUTION PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
UNITED STATES
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the
following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, which, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several
States, shall be valid to all intends and purposes as a part of the Constitution:
‘‘ARTICLE—.
‘‘SECTION 1. The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and prohibit the
labor of persons under eighteen years of age.
‘‘SECTION 2. The power of the several States is unimpaired by this article except
that the operation of State laws shall be suspended to the extent necessary to give
effect to legislation enacted by the Congress.’’
An amendment relative to equal rights for men and women was
proposed by the 2d session of the Ninety-second Congress on March
22, 1972, when it passed the Senate, having previously passed the
House on October 12, 1971. The seven-year deadline for ratification
of the proposed amendment was extended to June 30, 1982, by the
2d session of the Ninety-fifth Congress. The proposed amendment,
which was not ratified by three-fourths of the States by June 30,
1982, is as follows:
